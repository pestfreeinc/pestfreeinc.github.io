<p>Without controls on population growth, organisms can quickly accomplish levels at which damage is triggered therefore becoming pests (e.g., locust swarms removing landscapes bare). For example, a rich area likely will have a lot of big, costly homes, so pest control expenses could be greater there since there's more area for a pest control company to cover in one of those houses.</p>
