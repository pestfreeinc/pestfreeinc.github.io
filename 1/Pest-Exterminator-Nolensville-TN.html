<p>Socio-psychological elements consisting of logical and ethical considerations were found to the motorists in IPM execution in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A survey of veggie growers in Sri Lanka showed that almost 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications prior to pest or disease incident and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A study carried out by Parsa et al. (2014) also revealed that a lack of certified IPM professionals and extension teachers was an obstacle for IPM implementation in industrialized nations.</p>
<p>There are lots of agricultural practices that make the environment less favorable to insect pests. IPM extended the idea of integrated control to all classes of pests and was expanded to include all strategies. This chapter talks about different methods to preserve pest insects at bearable levels or to put it simply integrated pest management (IPM). Keep children and family pets away from areas where pesticides have been used.</p>
<p>If pesticides are necessary, they are chosen and applied in such a way that avoids disrupting other IPM practices. Almost every kind of pest postures a threat to the residential or commercial properties they live in, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards. Beyond Pesticides supports the application of an Ecological Pest Management (EPM) or strongly defined Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program in the indoor environment, and Organic Land Care (OLC) practices in the outdoor environment.</p>
<p>Other pesticides, like surface sprays and termite treatments, remain in the environment for days, weeks or even longer after application. 9 Biological control can be a crucial element of an incorporated pest management programme. However by focusing on non-chemical options first, you can ensure that your pest management program is successfully eliminating pests at the least danger to your food safety program, non-target organisms and the environment.</p>
