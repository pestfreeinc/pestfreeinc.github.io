<p>IPM techniques consist of both chemical and nonchemical ways to prevent and control pest populations from reaching financially harmful levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the smallest efficient dose when other approaches of pest control have stopped working.

<p>The human reaction depends upon the significance of the damage done, and will range from tolerance, through deterrence and management, to attempts to completely eliminate the pest. Recent experiences with bug pest management for cotton in the southeastern United States will be utilized for essential examples in the discussion. The term Integrated Pest Management (IPM) describes pest control and prevention programs that count on numerous synchronised methods to obtain the wanted result.</p>
