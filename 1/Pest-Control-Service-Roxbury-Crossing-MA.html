<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a community technique to crop production and protection that integrates different management methods and practices to grow healthy crops and decrease the use of pesticides. Substantial decreases in the volumes and toxicity of pesticides applied can be achieved when an IPM program has actually been carried out effectively.

IoT- enabled wise traps permit a pest control professional to save time and money by eliminating the act of by hand checking each private trap throughout a place.</p>
