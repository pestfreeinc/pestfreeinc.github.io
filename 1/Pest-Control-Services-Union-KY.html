Biopesticides are normally suitable with natural opponents, however there are exceptions.</p>

Insects, diseases, and weeds can cause expensive and irreparable harm to livestock and crops. The insect pest control market is a fragmented one with a large number of domestic manufacturers, formulators, service, companies, and providers.</p>

HiCare's termite treatment services are among the best in the pest control business which's why it's a bestseller in Indian markets.
