<p>Biological control techniques can likewise be seen as natural solutions as they do not depend on making use of pesticides or other chemicals. Pest control is needed because insects and rodents carry diseases, infest your cooking areas and bed rooms, and bite you or your animals. Usage indicator plants to determine the effectiveness of pest management tactics and to keep an eye on prone crops for the infections (tospoviruses) such as impatiens necrotic area virus (INSV) and tomato spotted wilt infection (TSWV).</p>
