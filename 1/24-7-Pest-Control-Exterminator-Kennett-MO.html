<p>We are Top Rated Pest Control Company & having lot of customers in these areas. AIPM is owned and operated by University graduates who learnt Biology and Pest Management with an emphasis on Animal Damage Management. Testing may require examining plants and taping the number of pests or quantity of damage observed, or traps might be used to capture the pest species to estimate pest abundance.</p>

Numerous anti-pesticide NGOs have a much more simple definition of IPM - they see IPM as being nearly specifically about minimizing pesticide usage. If all other integrated pest management tactics are not able to keep an insect pest population below an economic threshold, then use of an insecticide to control the pest and avoid economic loss is justified.</p>
