<p>The determination of the correct reason for pest issue (understanding pest biology) and ecology is essential in manipulating the environment to the crop's advantage and to the detriment of the pest. Insecticides hazardous to a lot of insects (broad-spectrum) will more adversely impact natural opponents than materials that are narrow-spectrum or selective for specific insect types or life phases.</p>
