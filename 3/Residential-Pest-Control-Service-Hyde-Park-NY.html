The pest management industry is big, with over 15,000 companies serving the public and around 150,000 pest control service personnel. Cockroaches, mosquitoes, ants, rodents, termites, rats, wasps, bedbugs, lizards, mice, spiders, yellow jackets, bees and flies are commonly discovered pests in our society.</p>
<p>In the pest control stories, the children discovered that farmers use ladybirds to eliminate aphids on their crops, and that a large weed-eating underwater mammal (the manatee) is used by river authorities to keep waterways clear for boats.
