An efficient IPM program consists of pesticides for avoidance and active treatment. Utilizing entomopathogenic germs, fungis, microsporidia, nematodes, or viruses, and fermentation byproducts of some microbes versus arthropod pests, plant parasitic nematodes, and plant pathogens generally come under microbial control (Mankau 1981, Paulitz and Bélanger 2001, Dong and Zhang 2006, Lacey 2017 ).</p>
<p>It is really challenging to handle certain plant illness and arthropod pests through nonchemical methods in some crops (Flinckh et al. 2006 ). Inadequate control not only causes crop losses, but can result in their spread to larger locations making their control much more hard.
