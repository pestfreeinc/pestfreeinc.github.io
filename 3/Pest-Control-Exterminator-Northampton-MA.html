Integrated pest management (IPM) is a term used to describe an organized approach of handling pests using non-chemical pest management techniques and the sensible use of pesticides when pest populations surpass appropriate levels.</p>
<p>The term "integrated" was therefore synonymous with "suitable." Chemical controls were to be used only after routine monitoring showed that a pest population had reached a level (the financial threshold) that needed treatment to prevent the population from reaching a level (the economic injury level) at which financial losses would surpass the cost of the control measures.</p>
