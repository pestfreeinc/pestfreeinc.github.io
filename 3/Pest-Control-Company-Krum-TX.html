<p>For instance, according to the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS 2018 ), IPM is a sustainable, science-based, decision-making process that integrates biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools to identify, manage, and reduce risk from pests and pest management tools and strategies in a manner that minimizes general financial, health, and environmental risks.</p>
<p>Although botanical extracts such as azadirachtin and pyrethrins, and microbe-derived toxic metabolites such as avermectin and spinosad are considered as biologicals (Lasota and Dybas 1991, Sarfraz et al. 2005, Dodia et al. 2010 ), they are still chemical molecules, comparable to synthetic chemicals, and possess much of the human and environmental safety threats as chemical pesticides.</p>
<p>Opt for the least poisonous (or lowest schedule) family pesticide offered. The majority of people normally think of pest control throughout the warmer months, when swarms of insects try to attack their lawns and homes, however, pests know no season. A green pest management IPM program uses pesticides originated from plants, such as botanicals, or other naturally occurring products.</p>
<p>We offer residential pest control treatment throughout the within and out of your house to protect you, your family and your property from undesirable damages. Growers and pest control professionals must stay notified about existing and emerging pests and their management options. It shows how correct management of water-, energy- and absorbs balance contributes to a healthy crop less susceptible to diseases and pests.</p>
