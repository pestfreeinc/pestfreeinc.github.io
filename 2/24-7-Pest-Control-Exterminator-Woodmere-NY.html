<p>Biological control has actually been effectively utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To attend to intrusive pest issues, classical biological control method is usually used where natural enemies from the native area of the invasive pest are imported, increased, and released in the new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control technique that has been successfully used against a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
<p>Other pesticides, like surface sprays and termite treatments, stick around in the environment for days, weeks or perhaps longer after application. 9 Biological control can be an important part of an incorporated pest management programme.
