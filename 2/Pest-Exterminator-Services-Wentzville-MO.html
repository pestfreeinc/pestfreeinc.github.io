<p>Well-informed field teams will have the ability to keep track of and identify pest issues and efficiently execute the management strategies. The concept of integrated pest management (IPM) stemmed nearly 60 years ago in response to these negative impacts of pesticides. Numerous of the resources listed at the end of this leaflet can be utilized for identification of insect pests impacting collections.</p>
<p>IPM provides an effective, all incorporating, low-risk method to safeguard resources and individuals from pests. ABBA House Care clients experience pest free living often without any pesticides used inside. Pests develop resistance to biopesticides simply as they establish resistance to chemical pesticides.
