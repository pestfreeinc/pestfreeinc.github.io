The first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical techniques such as cultural practices, usage of resistant ranges, appropriate irrigation and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM thinks about the community as an entire and thinks about a well balanced mix of the previously mentioned control methods to produce the most effective and least destructive strategy.</p>
<p>Whether you have rodents or regular pests like spiders, ants, or roaches, we will determine the source of the problem. The goal is to provide a general understanding of the concepts of IPM, together with the principles for execution in all crops. When a crop is under tension it can be less capable of handling the tension brought on by insects that draw out plant sap (e.g. aphids, leafhoppers) and this stress may somewhat reduce the economic limit.</p>
