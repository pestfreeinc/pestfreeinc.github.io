<p>Concurrently, it is also based upon semiochemicals particularly kairomones and allomones 35 The pests are driven away or prevented far from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are simultaneously attracted (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be killed or removed 35 (Figure 5 ). Most pesticide problems are caused by a small number of the pesticides available today.</p>
<p>This method of pest control has actually fallen out of favour in current years because fire eliminates useful insects in addition to the pests and can have a negative influence on the soil. To lessen potential damage to useful insects, limit your spraying to little areas where you can see pests prowling, and leave a couple of unsprayed "havens" for any great bugs you can't see.</p>
