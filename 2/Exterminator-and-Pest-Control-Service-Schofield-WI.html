The chemical controls are used just after routine monitoring shows that a pest population had reached a financial threshold level. Many specific product growers, for such crop as potatoes and strawberries, are working to define what IPM suggests for their crop and area, and IPM-labeled foods are offered in restricted areas.</p>
