Commercial pest control companies have obligations that go far beyond that of handling and getting rid of pests.</p>
<p>There are many farming practices that make the environment less beneficial to insect pests. IPM extended the principle of integrated control to all classes of pests and was expanded to consist of all methods. This chapter discusses various techniques to keep pest insects at bearable levels or simply put integrated pest management (IPM). Keep children and animals away from locations where pesticides have been used.</p>

Lots of anti-pesticide NGOs have a much more simple definition of IPM - they see IPM as being nearly exclusively about decreasing pesticide usage.

We typically suggest pest control chemicals that finish the job using the least amount of item. Broad spectrum pesticides (as a last option).
