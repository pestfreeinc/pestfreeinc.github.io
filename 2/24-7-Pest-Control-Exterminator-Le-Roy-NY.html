<p>Natural opponents such as predatory arthropods and parasitic wasps can be extremely efficient in triggering considerable decreases in pest populations in particular circumstances (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ). Periodical releases of commercially available natural opponents or conserving natural enemy populations by offering havens or avoiding practices that damage them are a few of the common practices to control endemic pests.</p>
<p>Without controls on population development, organisms can quickly attain levels at which damage is caused therefore becoming pests (e.g., locust swarms removing landscapes bare). For example, a rich community likely will have a lot of large, expensive homes, so pest control costs could be higher there since there's more area for a pest control company to cover in among those houses.</p>
