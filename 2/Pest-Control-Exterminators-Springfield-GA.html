<p>Socio-psychological elements consisting of reasonable and moral considerations were discovered to the drivers in IPM implementation in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A survey of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka revealed that nearly 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications before pest or illness incident and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ).
