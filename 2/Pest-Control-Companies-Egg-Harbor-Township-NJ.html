<p>Pests or illness can be present in a crop without triggering financial damage. Accuracy applications of low toxicity pesticides rather than normal baseboard applications or treatment of a whole property also have proven to significantly reduce the total volumes of pesticides applied. Insect pests often have natural enemies that are useful to the landscape.</p>
