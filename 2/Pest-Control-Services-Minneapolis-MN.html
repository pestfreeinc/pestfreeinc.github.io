<p>A redirection of pest management is needed to include year-round soil, weed, cropping, water, and associated practices at farm and community levels and to consider the impacts of these practices on the general animals, nutritional state, and balance of local environments (16 ). Integrated pest management (IPM) is a term utilized to describe a systematic approach of managing pests utilizing non-chemical pest management techniques and the cautious usage of pesticides when pest populations go beyond appropriate levels.</p>
<p>The term "integrated" was hence synonymous with "compatible." Chemical controls were to be applied just after regular monitoring suggested that a pest population had reached a level (the financial threshold) that required treatment to avoid the population from reaching a level (the economic injury level) at which financial losses would surpass the expense of the control measures.</p>
