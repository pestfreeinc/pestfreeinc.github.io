<p>A redirection of pest management is needed to include year-round soil, weed, cropping, water, and associated practices at farm and community levels and to consider the impacts of these practices on the general animals, nutritional state, and balance of local environments (16 ). Integrated pest management (IPM) is a term utilized to describe a systematic approach of managing pests utilizing non-chemical pest management techniques and the cautious usage of pesticides when pest populations go beyond appropriate levels.</p>
<p>The term "integrated" was hence synonymous with "compatible." Chemical controls were to be applied just after regular monitoring suggested that a pest population had reached a level (the financial threshold) that required treatment to avoid the population from reaching a level (the economic injury level) at which financial losses would surpass the expense of the control measures.</p>

Instead, the pest control service technician should concentrate on the food handling and vending locations, utilizing bait applications instead of spraying.

<p>In IPM, pesticides are utilized only when needed and in mix with other techniques for more efficient, long-term control. The advantages of GM crops extend beyond the decrease in insecticides, since they are compatible with other pest management techniques, particularly biological control.
