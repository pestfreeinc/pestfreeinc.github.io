<p>For example, according to the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS 2018 ), IPM is a sustainable, science-based, decision-making process that integrates biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools to identify, handle, and decrease threat from pests and pest management tools and methods in a manner that reduces total economic, health, and ecological risks.</p>
<p>In recommendation to the principle of integrating the use of biological and other controls in complementary ways, the term was later widened to embrace coordinated usage of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural opponents are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural opponents have actually been chosen either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to possess higher levels of resistance.</p>
<p>But, the charges mainly depends on the type of pests management, size of the area and seriousness of the problem. Acosta, EW (2006) The History of Integrated Pest Management (IPM). In a close-by plot, less seed and fertilizer were used and no pesticides were made an application for 40 days after planting. You see, hiring pest control services is an excellent use of money after all.</p>

When it is really needed, requirements of plagued areas and separated application of plant protection products reduce the damage for humans and nature as chemicals are used only.</p>
