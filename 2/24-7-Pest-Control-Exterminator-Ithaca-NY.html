<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to draw in and vacuum the western ruined plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has actually been suggested as an IPM strategy by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the idea did not take off because growers were not prepared for such an intercropping arrangement. If your facility presently makes use of an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you will not be shocked to hear that the pest control market has and will continue to approach least-impact services and products.</p>
<p>In referral to the concept of integrating making use of other and biological controls in complementary methods, the term was later on expanded to accept collaborated usage of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962).
