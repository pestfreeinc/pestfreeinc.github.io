AIPM is owned and run by University graduates who learnt Biology and Pest Management with an emphasis on Animal Damage Management. Testing may require taking a look at plants and tape-recording the variety of pests or amount of damage observed, or traps might be used to capture the pest species to estimate pest abundance.</p>
<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control home pest pests. Numerous anti-pesticide NGOs have a a lot more simplistic definition of IPM - they see IPM as being practically exclusively about minimizing pesticide usage. If all other integrated pest management methods are not able to keep an insect pest population below an economic limit, then use of an insecticide to control the pest and prevent financial loss is justified.</p>
<p>Reliable, less risky pest controls are selected first, including highly targeted chemicals, such as pheromones to interrupt pest mating, or mechanical control, such as trapping or weeding. Evaluation is often one of the most important actions in Integrated Pest Management (Bennett et al., 2005 ). It is the procedure of evaluating an IPM program and the results it has actually generated.</p>
