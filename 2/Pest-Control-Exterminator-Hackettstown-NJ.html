<p>The new ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi) technology where double-stranded RNA is used to silence particular genes in the target bug is thought about as biopesticide application (Gordon and Waterhouse 2007 ). Specific biostimulants based on minerals, microbes, plant extracts, seaweed or algae impart induced systemic resistance to pests, diseases, and abiotic stress factors, but are used as changes with no claims for pest or disease control (Larkin 2008, Vleesschauwer and Höfte 2009, Sharma et al. 2014, López-Bucio et al 2015, Dara 2018a ). These new products or technologies can fall into one or more abovementioned classifications of pest management.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural enemies and discourage pest perseverance include intercropping (numerous crops in the same field) to make it more difficult for pests to discover a host plant, planting trap crops which bring in pests away from harvest crops and which can later be treated with select application of pesticides, and delaying planting times to coincide with times where pests have emerged and died off for the season.</p>
<p>The human reaction depends on the importance of the damage done, and will range from tolerance, through deterrence and management, to efforts to entirely eliminate the pest. Recent experiences with insect pest management for cotton in the southeastern United States will be used for crucial examples in the conversation. The term Integrated Pest Management (IPM) describes pest control and avoidance programs that depend on a number of synchronised approaches to obtain the desired result.</p>
<p>A few of these are: neem spray, prepared from neem kernels (Azadirachta indica) extract, efficient against sucking pests, jassids, bollworms and thrips; pyrethrum, prepared from powdered flower heads or liquid extracts of chrysanthemum, reliable against red cotton bug, cutworms, grasshoppers; botanical mixtures, combinations of extracts from different plants such as castor, thorn apple, lantana, custard apple, sweet potato leaves, tomato leaves, ginger, chilly, gliricidia, marigold, and so on</p>
